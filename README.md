### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: Put Your View Controllers On a Diet With MVVM

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

In the [first installment](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/why-mvc-might-not-be-best-for-cocoa-apps--cms-29423) of this series, I wrote about the Model-View-Controller pattern and some of its imperfections. Despite the clear benefits MVC brings to software development, it tends to fall short in large or complex Cocoa applications.

This isn't news, though. Several architectural patterns have emerged over the years, aiming to address the shortcomings of the Model-View-Controller pattern. You may have heard of MVP, Model-View-Presenter, and MVVM, Model-View-ViewModel, for example. These patterns look and feel similar to the Model-View-Controller pattern, but they also tackle some of the issues the Model-View-Controller pattern suffers from.
